<h1>Welcome to veniwotwot's github page.</h1>

<p>I'm so glad that you are here, checking out my progress and (hopefully) enjoying your time here! 
  The buttons below will bring you to where you want to go (probably)!</p>

<p>Beware, monosnake and duosnake do not currently handle window sizing very well.
   You may have to manually resize your browser in order to view the full screen.</p>


<p>More games and projects worth viewing are coming soon! 
  Maybe around the time they come out, I'll invest the time to create a prettier looking page.</p>
